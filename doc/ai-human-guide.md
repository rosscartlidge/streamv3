*Complete guide for humans on getting the best StreamV3 code from AI assistants*

---

## 🎯 Overview

This guide teaches you how to effectively use Large Language Models (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) to generate high-quality StreamV3 code from natural language descriptions.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Setting up your LLM for StreamV3 code generation
- Writing effective requests
- Verifying and iterating on generated code
- Using interactive CLI tools for maximum productivity
- Troubleshooting common issues

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Copy the Prompt

Open **[ai-code-generation.md](ai-code-generation.md)** and copy the entire contents (the code block starting with "You are an expert Go developer...").

### Step 2: Paste into Your LLM

Paste the prompt as your first message in:
- Claude (https://claude.ai)
- ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com)
- Gemini (https://gemini.google.com)
- Or your preferred LLM

### Step 3: Describe What You Want

```
"Read sales data from sales.csv, filter for amounts over $500,
group by region, and show total sales per region"
```

The LLM will generate clean, working Go code that follows StreamV3 best practices.

---

## 💻 Interactive Development with CLI Tools

For the most powerful experience, use LLM CLI tools that can **run and iterate on code** for you.

### Claude Code (Recommended)

**What it is**: Official CLI from Anthropic that combines Claude's intelligence with direct filesystem access and code execution.

**Installation**:
```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

**Setup for StreamV3 (Option 1: Quick)**:
```bash
cd my-streamv3-project
claude-code

# First message: Copy and paste the entire contents of
# doc/ai-code-generation.md from the StreamV3 repository
```

**Setup for StreamV3 (Option 2: Persistent - Recommended)**:
```bash
# In your project directory
mkdir -p .claude

# Create project-specific CLAUDE.md
cat > .claude/CLAUDE.md << 'EOF'
# StreamV3 Project

This project uses StreamV3 for stream processing.

## StreamV3 Reference

For complete API documentation, use:
```bash
go doc github.com/rosscartlidge/streamv3
go doc github.com/rosscartlidge/streamv3.FunctionName
```

## Quick Rules

- Use SQL-style names: `Select`, `Where`, `Limit` (not Map, Filter, Take)
- Always handle errors from ReadCSV, ReadJSON, etc.
- CSV auto-parses numbers: use `GetOr(r, "age", int64(0))` not `GetOr(r, "age", "")`
- **🚨 CRITICAL**: Record fields are NOT directly accessible - use `MakeMutableRecord()` to create, `GetOr()` to read
- Only import packages actually used

## 🚨 Record Access (v1.0+)

**CRITICAL: Record is an encapsulated struct, NOT map[string]any**

```go
// ❌ WRONG - Direct field access will NOT compile
record["name"] = "Alice"
value := record["age"]

// ✅ CORRECT - Use builder and accessors
record := streamv3.MakeMutableRecord().
    String("name", "Alice").
    Int("age", int64(30)).
    Freeze()

name := streamv3.GetOr(record, "name", "")
age, exists := streamv3.Get[int64](record, "age")
```

This applies to ALL external code (user code, LLM-generated code, examples).

## Important Patterns

- Read CSV: `data, err := streamv3.ReadCSV("file.csv"); if err != nil { log.Fatal(err) }`
- Filter: `streamv3.Where(func(r Record) bool { return condition })(data)`
- Group: `streamv3.GroupByFields("groupName", "field1", "field2")(data)`
- Aggregate: `streamv3.Aggregate("groupName", map[string]AggregateFunc{...})(grouped)`
- Chart: `streamv3.QuickChart(data, "x", "y", "output.html")`
EOF

# Start Claude Code - it will read .claude/CLAUDE.md automatically
claude-code
```

**Example Session**:
```
You: "Read my sales.csv file and show me what fields are in it"

Claude Code:
✓ Read sales.csv
✓ Found fields: date, product, amount, region
✓ Showed first 5 records

You: "Filter for sales over $500, group by region, show totals"

Claude Code:
✓ Generated code
✓ Created main.go
✓ Ran: go run main.go
✓ Displayed results
[If errors occur, automatically fixes them]

You: "Now add a chart"

Claude Code:
✓ Updated code with chart
✓ Ran code
✓ Opened chart.html in browser
```

**Why It's Powerful**:
- ✅ Automatic iteration (fixes errors on its own)
- ✅ File awareness (reads your actual data)
- ✅ Runs code (executes and tests)
- ✅ Context aware (remembers project structure)
- ✅ StreamV3 knowledge (via CLAUDE.md)

### Other CLI Tools

**Gemini CLI**:
```bash
npm install -g @google/generative-ai-cli
gemini-cli
# Paste ai-code-generation.md prompt, then start coding
```

**Aider (Multi-backend)**:
```bash
pip install aider-chat
aider
# Works with GPT-4, Claude, local models
```

**GitHub Copilot CLI**:
```bash
gh extension install github/gh-copilot
gh copilot suggest "create streamv3 pipeline to analyze sales"
```

## 📝 Writing Effective Requests

### ✅ Good Request Patterns

**1. Be Specific About Data**:
```
❌ "Analyze some data"
✅ "Read customer data from customers.csv, filter for customers with orders > $1000"
```

**2. Describe the Steps**:
```
❌ "Do sales analysis"
✅ "Read sales.csv, group by product category, calculate total revenue per category, show top 5"
```

**3. Mention Output Format**:
```
❌ "Show results"
✅ "Display results in console and create a bar chart saved as sales_chart.html"
```

**4. Specify Data Fields**:
```
❌ "Filter the data"
✅ "Filter for records where the 'amount' field is greater than 500"
```

### Request Templates

**Data Analysis**:
```
"Read [filename] data, filter for [condition], group by [field],
calculate [aggregation], and [output format]"
```

**Real-Time Processing**:
```
"Process [data source] in [time window] windows, calculate [metric],
alert when [condition]"
```

**Visualization**:
```
"Create [chart type] showing [metric] by [dimension] from [data source]"
```

**Join Analysis**:
```
"Join [dataset1] with [dataset2] on [key], find [pattern],
calculate [metric]"
```

## ✅ Verifying Generated Code

### Quick Verification Checklist

When you receive generated code, check:

#### Structure Check
- [ ] Has `package main` and `func main()`
- [ ] Includes all necessary imports
- [ ] **Only** imports packages actually used
- [ ] Handles errors from file operations
- [ ] Uses descriptive variable names

#### StreamV3 API Check
- [ ] Uses SQL-style names (`Select`, `Where`, `Limit`)
- [ ] NOT using wrong names (`Map`, `Filter`, `Take`)
- [ ] Uses `MakeMutableRecord().Freeze()` for record creation
- [ ] Uses `streamv3.GetOr()` for safe record access
- [ ] Includes group names in `GroupByFields()` and `Aggregate()`

#### Logic Check
- [ ] Processing steps are in logical order
- [ ] Each step is clearly understandable
- [ ] Variable names match their purpose
- [ ] Comments explain complex logic

#### Type Safety Check
- [ ] Numeric CSV fields use `int64` or `float64`
- [ ] Uses correct default values with `GetOr()`
- [ ] Type parameters included where needed

### Common Issues to Watch For

**❌ API Mistakes**:
```go
// Wrong - old/incorrect API
result := streamv3.Map(fn)(data)      // Should be Select
result := streamv3.Filter(fn)(data)   // Should be Where
result := streamv3.Take(10)(data)     // Should be Limit
record := streamv3.NewRecord().Build() // Should be MakeMutableRecord().Freeze()
```

**❌ Missing Error Handling**:
```go
// Wrong - no error check
data := streamv3.ReadCSV("file.csv")

// Correct - always check errors
data, err := streamv3.ReadCSV("file.csv")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to read CSV: %v", err)
}
```

**❌ Wrong Types for CSV Data**:
```go
// Wrong - CSV parses "25" as int64, not string
age := streamv3.GetOr(record, "age", "")

// Correct - use int64 for numeric CSV values
age := streamv3.GetOr(record, "age", int64(0))
```

## 🔄 Iterating and Refining

### When First Result Isn't Perfect

**Strategy 1: Ask for Clarification**:
```
"The code looks good, but can you add comments explaining the aggregation step?"
```

**Strategy 2: Request Modifications**:
```
"Can you modify this to also calculate the standard deviation of sales amounts?"
```

**Strategy 3: Ask for Simplification**:
```
"This code is complex. Can you break it into simpler steps with more descriptive variable names?"
```

**Strategy 4: Request Different Approach**:
```
"Instead of grouping by region first, can you filter for high-value sales first, then group?"
```

### Example Iteration Session

**Round 1**:
```
You: "Analyze sales data to find top-performing products"
LLM: [generates basic code]
```

**Round 2**:
```
You: "Good start! Can you modify this to:
1. Only include sales from the last 30 days
2. Calculate both revenue and unit sales
3. Show the top 10 products by revenue
4. Create a bar chart of the results"
LLM: [generates enhanced code]
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Code Uses Wrong Function Names

**Symptoms**: `Map()`, `Filter()`, `Take()` instead of `Select()`, `Where()`, `Limit()`

**Solution**:
```
"Please update this code to use the current StreamV3 API:
Select instead of Map, Where instead of Filter, Limit instead of Take"
```

### Problem: Complex, Hard-to-Read Code

**Symptoms**: Deeply nested function calls, unclear variable names

**Solution**:
```
"Can you rewrite this with simpler, step-by-step processing?
Use descriptive variable names and break complex operations into separate steps."
```

### Problem: Missing Error Handling

**Symptoms**: File operations without error checks

**Solution**:
```
"Please add proper error handling for all file operations and CSV reading"
```

### Problem: Wrong Record Creation API

**Symptoms**: `NewRecord().Build()` instead of `MakeMutableRecord().Freeze()`

**Solution**:
```
"Please update to use MakeMutableRecord().Freeze() for record creation"
```

### Problem: Type Issues with CSV Data

**Symptoms**: Using wrong types for numeric CSV fields

**Solution**:
```
"CSV auto-parses numbers. Please use int64 for integer fields
and float64 for decimal fields with GetOr()"
```

### When Your LLM Gets Confused

**Reset and Restart**:
1. Start a new conversation
2. Reapply the prompt template from ai-code-generation.md
3. Rephrase your request more clearly
4. Provide a simple example first

**Provide Examples**:
```
"Here's an example of the coding style I want:

```go
// Read and filter data
data, err := streamv3.ReadCSV("sales.csv")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

highValueSales := streamv3.Where(func(r streamv3.Record) bool {
    amount := streamv3.GetOr(r, "amount", 0.0)
    return amount > 1000
})(data)
```

Now create similar code for analyzing customer data."
```

## 💡 Best Practices

### 1. Start Simple, Build Complexity

✅ **Good Progression**:
1. "Read sales.csv and show first 10 records"
2. "Filter for sales > $100"
3. "Group by region and calculate totals"
4. "Create chart of results"

❌ **Avoid**:
"Build a comprehensive sales analytics dashboard with real-time monitoring,
predictive analytics, and machine learning"

### 2. Be Specific About Data

✅ **Good**:
"The CSV has columns: customer_id, order_date, product_name, quantity, unit_price, total_amount"

❌ **Vague**:
"Analyze the sales data"

### 3. Request Human-Readable Code

✅ **Always Ask For**:
"Make the code easy to read and verify, with descriptive variable names and clear steps"

❌ **Don't Accept**:
Complex nested function calls that are hard to understand

### 4. Verify Each Step

✅ **Good Practice**:
"Before adding the chart, let me verify the data processing logic first"

❌ **Risky**:
Accepting large, complex code without reviewing each component

### 5. Build a Pattern Library

Save successful request patterns:
```
📁 Your Pattern Library:
- "Read [file], filter for [condition], group by [field], calculate [metric]"
- "Process [data] in [time] windows, detect [pattern], alert when [condition]"
- "Join [dataset1] with [dataset2], find [insight], create [visualization]"
```

### 6. Test with Small Data First

✅ **Smart Approach**:
"Generate code to test with a small sample file first, then we'll apply it to the full dataset"

❌ **Risky**:
Running generated code on large production datasets without testing

## 📚 Advanced Techniques

### 1. Multi-Step Requests

Break complex analyses into phases:
```
"First, help me understand this data structure.
Then I'll ask you to build the analysis pipeline."

Phase 1: "Read my sales.csv and show me what fields are available"
Phase 2: "Now create analysis to find seasonal sales patterns by product category"
Phase 3: "Add visualization and export the results"
```

### 2. Domain-Specific Language

Teach the LLM your domain terminology:
```
"In our retail business:
- 'SKU' means product identifier
- 'COGS' means cost of goods sold
- 'LTV' means customer lifetime value

Now analyze our product performance using these terms."
```

### 3. Template Creation

Ask for reusable templates:
```
"Create a template function that can analyze any CSV file to find
top N records by any numeric field, with flexible grouping"
```

### 4. Error Handling Strategies

Request robust error handling:
```
"Generate the sales analysis code, but make it robust - handle missing files,
empty data, and invalid field values gracefully"
```
