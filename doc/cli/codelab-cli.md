## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install the CLI tool
go install github.com/rosscartlidge/streamv3/cmd/streamv3@latest

# Verify installation
streamv3 -version
```

### Your First Pipeline

```bash
# Create a sample CSV file
cat > employees.csv << 'EOF'
name,age,department,salary
Alice,30,Engineering,95000
Bob,25,Marketing,65000
Carol,35,Engineering,105000
David,28,Sales,70000
EOF

# Process it with a pipeline
streamv3 read-csv employees.csv | \
  streamv3 where -match department eq Engineering | \
  streamv3 select -field name -field salary
```

Output:
```json
{"name":"Alice","salary":95000}
{"name":"Carol","salary":105000}
```

## What is the StreamV3 CLI?

The StreamV3 CLI brings Unix pipeline philosophy to structured data processing. It provides:

- **üîó Pipeline Operations** - Chain commands with Unix pipes
- **üìä Built-in Visualization** - Create charts directly from pipelines
- **ü§ñ Code Generation** - Convert CLI commands to Go code
- **‚ö° Interactive Development** - Prototype fast, then generate production code

### Key Features

**Command Chaining**
```bash
streamv3 read-csv data.csv | streamv3 where ... | streamv3 group-by ... | streamv3 chart ...
```

**Self-Generating Commands**
Every command supports `-generate` flag to emit Go code instead of executing:
```bash
streamv3 read-csv -generate data.csv | streamv3 generate-go
```

**Universal Data Format**
All commands use JSONL (JSON Lines) for inter-command communication, enabling complex pipelines.

**Debugging with jq**
Since all commands communicate via JSONL, you can inspect data at any stage with `jq`:
```bash
streamv3 read-csv data.csv | jq '.' | head -5          # Pretty-print data
streamv3 read-csv data.csv | jq '.age | type' | head   # Check field types
streamv3 ... | streamv3 where ... | jq -s 'length'      # Count results
```
[**See full debugging guide ‚Üí**](debugging_pipelines.md)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Development Status**: The CLI is under active development. Commands and flags may change. Use `-help` on any command to see current options.

## Basic Pipeline Operations

### Reading Data

Read CSV files and output as JSONL:

```bash
streamv3 read-csv employees.csv
```

Output (JSONL):
```json
{"_row_number":0,"age":30,"department":"Engineering","name":"Alice","salary":95000}
{"_row_number":1,"age":25,"department":"Marketing","name":"Bob","salary":65000}
...
```

### Filtering Data

Filter records based on conditions:

```bash
# Single condition
streamv3 read-csv employees.csv | \
  streamv3 where -match salary gt 70000

# Multiple conditions (AND)
streamv3 read-csv employees.csv | \
  streamv3 where -match age gt 25 -match department eq Engineering

# Multiple conditions (OR) - use + separator
streamv3 read-csv employees.csv | \
  streamv3 where -match department eq Engineering + -match department eq Sales
```

**Available Operators:**
- `eq` - Equal
- `ne` - Not equal
- `gt` - Greater than
- `lt` - Less than
- `ge` - Greater than or equal
- `le` - Less than or equal
- `contains` - String contains
- `starts` - String starts with
- `ends` - String ends with

### Selecting Fields

Select specific fields or rename them:

```bash
# Select fields
streamv3 read-csv employees.csv | \
  streamv3 select -field name -field salary

# Rename fields
streamv3 read-csv employees.csv | \
  streamv3 select -field name -as employee_name -field salary -as annual_salary
```

### Writing Output

Write results to CSV:

```bash
streamv3 read-csv employees.csv | \
  streamv3 where -match department eq Engineering | \
  streamv3 write-csv engineers.csv
```

---

## Working with Real Data

### Processing Command Output

Execute shell commands and parse their output:

```bash
# Analyze process information
streamv3 exec -- ps -efl | \
  streamv3 where -match CMD contains chrome | \
  streamv3 select -field PID -field USER -field CMD
```

**Note:** The `--` separator is required to prevent StreamV3 from interpreting command flags like `-efl` as its own flags.

### Example: System Monitoring

Find memory-intensive processes:

```bash
# Get top memory users
streamv3 exec -- ps aux | \
  streamv3 where -match USER eq root | \
  streamv3 select -field PID -field MEM -field CMD | \
  streamv3 write-csv system_processes.csv
```

---

## Grouping and Aggregations

Group data and calculate statistics:

### Basic Aggregation

```bash
# Count records by department
streamv3 read-csv employees.csv | \
  streamv3 group-by -by department -function count -result total
```

Output:
```json
{"department":"Engineering","total":3}
{"department":"Marketing","total":2}
{"department":"Sales","total":1}
```

### Multiple Aggregations

Use `+` to separate multiple aggregation functions:

```bash
streamv3 read-csv employees.csv | \
  streamv3 group-by -by department \
    -function count -result employee_count + \
    -function avg -field salary -result avg_salary + \
    -function max -field salary -result max_salary
```

Output:
```json
{"avg_salary":98333,"department":"Engineering","employee_count":3,"max_salary":105000}
{"avg_salary":65000,"department":"Marketing","employee_count":2,"max_salary":65000}
{"avg_salary":70000,"department":"Sales","employee_count":1,"max_salary":70000}
```

**Available Aggregation Functions:**
- `count` - Count records
- `sum` - Sum values
- `avg` - Average values
- `min` - Minimum value
- `max` - Maximum value

---

## SQL-Like Operations

StreamV3 supports common SQL operations for multi-table queries and data manipulation.

### Pagination with OFFSET and LIMIT

Skip and take records for pagination:

```bash
# Skip first 20 records, take next 10 (records 21-30)
streamv3 read-csv data.csv | \
  streamv3 offset -n 20 | \
  streamv3 limit -n 10
```

Equivalent SQL:
```sql
SELECT * FROM data LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20
```

### Remove Duplicates with DISTINCT

Remove duplicate records:

```bash
# Distinct on all fields
streamv3 read-csv data.csv | streamv3 distinct

# Distinct by specific fields
streamv3 read-csv employees.csv | \
  streamv3 distinct -by department -by location
```

Equivalent SQL:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department, location FROM employees
```

### JOIN Operations

Join two data sources on common fields:

```bash
# Inner join on same field name
streamv3 read-csv employees.csv | \
  streamv3 join -type inner -right departments.csv -on dept_id

# Left join with different field names
streamv3 read-csv orders.csv | \
  streamv3 join -type left -right customers.csv \
    -left-field customer_id -right-field id

# Join on multiple fields (composite key)
streamv3 read-csv sales.csv | \
  streamv3 join -right products.csv \
    -on product_id -on region
```

**Join Types:**
- `inner` - Only matching records (default)
- `left` - All left records, matched right records
- `right` - All right records, matched left records
- `full` - All records from both sides

Equivalent SQL:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
```

### UNION Operations

Combine multiple data sources:

```bash
# UNION (remove duplicates)
streamv3 read-csv customers.csv | \
  streamv3 union -file suppliers.csv

# UNION ALL (keep duplicates)
streamv3 read-csv file1.csv | \
  streamv3 union -all -file file2.csv -file file3.csv
```

Equivalent SQL:
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
UNION
SELECT * FROM suppliers
```

---

## Creating Visualizations

Generate interactive HTML charts with Chart.js:

### Simple Chart

```bash
streamv3 read-csv employees.csv | \
  streamv3 chart -x department -y salary -output salary_chart.html
```

Opens `salary_chart.html` with an interactive chart featuring:
- Multiple chart types (line, bar, scatter, pie, radar)
- Zoom and pan controls
- Field selection UI
- Data export to PNG/CSV

### Chart with Aggregations

```bash
streamv3 read-csv employees.csv | \
  streamv3 group-by -by department \
    -function avg -field salary -result avg_salary | \
  streamv3 chart -x department -y avg_salary -output dept_salaries.html
```

---

## Code Generation

Every command supports the `-generate` flag to output Go code instead of executing:

### Generate Code from Pipeline

```bash
streamv3 read-csv -generate employees.csv | \
  streamv3 where -generate -match department eq Engineering | \
  streamv3 select -generate -field name -field salary | \
  streamv3 write-csv -generate output.csv | \
  streamv3 generate-go
```

Output:
```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/rosscartlidge/streamv3"
)

func main() {
	records := streamv3.ReadCSV("employees.csv")
	filtered := streamv3.Where(func(r streamv3.Record) bool {
		return r["department"].(string) == "Engineering"
	})(records)
	selected := streamv3.Select(func(r streamv3.Record) streamv3.Record {
		result := make(streamv3.Record)
		result["name"] = r["name"]
		result["salary"] = r["salary"]
		return result
	})(filtered)
	streamv3.WriteCSV(selected, "output.csv")
}
```

### Compile and Run Generated Code

```bash
# Generate code to file
streamv3 read-csv -generate data.csv | \
  streamv3 group-by -generate -by region -function sum -field sales -result total | \
  streamv3 generate-go > analysis.go

# Add package initialization
cat > go.mod << 'EOF'
module analysis
go 1.23
require github.com/rosscartlidge/streamv3 latest
EOF

# Build and run
go mod tidy
go run analysis.go
```

---

## Complete Example

Let's build a comprehensive data analysis pipeline:

### Scenario: Analyze Process Counts by User

```bash
# Execute the pipeline
streamv3 exec -- ps -efl | \
  streamv3 group-by -by UID -function count -result process_count | \
  streamv3 chart -x UID -y process_count -output /tmp/processes_by_user.html
```

This will:
1. Execute `ps -efl` and parse the output
2. Group processes by UID (user)
3. Count processes per user
4. Create an interactive chart

Output: `Chart created: /tmp/processes_by_user.html`

### Generate Production Code

Now convert the same pipeline to Go code:

```bash
streamv3 exec -generate -- ps -efl | \
  streamv3 group-by -generate -by UID -function count -result process_count | \
  streamv3 chart -generate -x UID -y process_count -output processes.html | \
  streamv3 generate-go > monitor.go
```

Generated code in `monitor.go`:
```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/rosscartlidge/streamv3"
)

func main() {
	records := streamv3.ExecCommand("ps", []string{"-efl"})
	grouped := streamv3.GroupByFields("_group", "UID")(records)
	aggregated := streamv3.Aggregate("_group", map[string]streamv3.AggregateFunc{
		"process_count": streamv3.Count(),
	})(grouped)
	streamv3.QuickChart(aggregated, "UID", "process_count", "processes.html")
}
```

Compile and run:
```bash
# Setup module
go mod init monitor
go get github.com/rosscartlidge/streamv3

# Build and run
go build -o monitor monitor.go
./monitor
```

### Getting Help

```bash
# Show all commands
streamv3 -help

# Show command-specific help
streamv3 read-csv -help
streamv3 where -help
streamv3 group-by -help
streamv3 chart -help
```

### Bash Completion

The CLI supports intelligent tab completion for commands, flags, and even field names:

```bash
# Install bash completion (for current session)
eval "$(streamv3 -bash-completion)"

# Install permanently
streamv3 -bash-completion > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/streamv3

# Or add to ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(streamv3 -bash-completion)"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now you can tab-complete:
```bash
streamv3 <TAB>          # Shows all commands
streamv3 where <TAB>    # Shows flags like -match, -help
streamv3 read-csv <TAB> # Completes .csv files
```

### Understanding Command Structure (Advanced)

StreamV3 CLI uses the **completionflags** framework for declarative command definitions. This enables powerful features:

**Clause Pattern:**
Commands that support multiple items use `+` as a separator to create "clauses". Each clause can have its own set of flags:

```bash
# Multiple WHERE conditions (OR logic) - each clause after + is independent
streamv3 where -match age gt 30 + -match salary gt 100000

# Multiple aggregations - each + starts a new aggregation
streamv3 group-by -by department \
  -function count -result total + \
  -function avg -field salary -result avg_salary + \
  -function max -field salary -result max_salary
```

**How it works:**
- **Before `+`**: First clause with its flags
- **After `+`**: New clause starts, can have different flags
- **Framework**: Automatically parses and validates all flags
- **Benefits**: Type safety, auto-completion, consistent error messages

**Example breakdown:**
```bash
streamv3 group-by -by department \
  -function count -result total + \
  #     ‚îî‚îÄ Clause 1 ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò   ‚îÇ
  -function avg -field salary -result avg_salary
  #     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Clause 2 ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

Each clause is independently validated, so you get clear error messages if flags are missing or incorrect.

**Global vs Local Flags:**
- **Global flags** apply to the entire command: `-by department`, `-generate`
- **Local flags** belong to specific clauses: `-function`, `-field`, `-result`

This pattern makes complex commands readable while maintaining type safety and completion support.
