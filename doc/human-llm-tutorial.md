## Quick Start

### Step 1: Prime Your LLM

**Recommended:**
1. Open the file **[streamv3-ai-prompt.md](streamv3-ai-prompt.md)**
2. Copy the entire contents of that file (everything from "You are an expert Go developer..." to the end)
3. Paste it as your first message in your LLM conversation (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)

This teaches the LLM how to generate proper StreamV3 code following the project's conventions.

**Alternative:** If you need a custom prompt, here's the essential content:

```
You are an expert Go developer specializing in StreamV3, a modern Go stream processing library. Generate high-quality, idiomatic StreamV3 code from natural language descriptions.

üéØ PRIMARY GOAL: Human-Readable, Verifiable Code

StreamV3 Quick Reference:

Standard Imports:
import (
    "fmt"
    "slices"
    "time"
    "github.com/rosscartlidge/streamv3"
)

Note: DO NOT import "iter" unless you explicitly need to reference iterator types. Typically not needed.

Core Operations (SQL-style naming):
- Transform: Select(func(T) U), SelectMany(func(T) iter.Seq[U])
- Filter: Where(func(T) bool), Distinct(), DistinctBy(func(T) K)
- Limit: Limit(n), Offset(n)
- Sort: Sort(), SortBy(func(T) K), SortDesc(), Reverse()
- Group: GroupByFields("groupName", "field1", "field2")
- Aggregate: Aggregate("groupName", map[string]AggregateFunc{...})
- Join: InnerJoin(rightSeq, predicate), LeftJoin(), RightJoin(), FullJoin()
- Window: CountWindow[T](size), TimeWindow[T](duration, "timeField"), SlidingCountWindow[T](size, step)

Record Access:
- streamv3.GetOr(record, "key", defaultValue) ‚Üí T
- streamv3.Get[T](record, "key") ‚Üí (T, bool)

Code Generation Rules:
1. Keep it simple: Write code humans can quickly read and verify - no clever tricks
2. One step at a time: Break complex operations into clear, logical steps
3. Descriptive variables: Use names like filteredSales, groupedData
4. Always handle errors from file operations
5. Use SQL-style names: Select not Map, Where not Filter, Limit not Take
6. Complete examples: Include main function and imports

Generate clean, working Go code that follows these patterns.
```

### Step 2: Make Your Request

Now describe what you want in plain English:

```
"Read sales data from sales.csv, filter for amounts over $500, group by region, and show total sales per region"
```

### Step 3: Review and Use

The LLM will generate clean, step-by-step code that you can easily read and verify.

## Writing Effective Requests

### ‚úÖ Good Request Patterns

#### 1. Be Specific About Data
```
‚ùå "Analyze some data"
‚úÖ "Read customer data from customers.csv, filter for customers with orders > $1000"
```

#### 2. Describe the Steps
```
‚ùå "Do sales analysis"
‚úÖ "Read sales.csv, group by product category, calculate total revenue per category, show top 5"
```

#### 3. Mention Output Format
```

Example: "Join customers.csv with orders.csv on customer_id, find high-value customers, calculate lifetime value"
```

---

## Common Request Patterns

### 1. Basic Data Analysis

**Request:**
```
"Read employee data from employees.csv, group by department and location, count employees in each group, then filter to show only groups with more than 5 employees"
```

**Expected Output:**
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/rosscartlidge/streamv3"
)

func main() {
    // Read employee data
    employees := streamv3.ReadCSV("employees.csv")

    // Group by department and location
    grouped := streamv3.GroupByFields("dept_location_analysis", "department", "location")(employees)

    // Count employees in each group
    employeeCounts := streamv3.Aggregate("dept_location_analysis", map[string]streamv3.AggregateFunc{
        "employee_count": streamv3.Count(),
    })(grouped)

    // Filter to show only groups with more than 5 employees
    largeGroups := streamv3.Where(func(r streamv3.Record) bool {
        count := streamv3.GetOr(r, "employee_count", int64(0))
        return count > 5
    })(employeeCounts)

    // Display results
    fmt.Println("Department/Location groups with more than 5 employees:")
    for result := range largeGroups {
        dept := streamv3.GetOr(result, "department", "")
        location := streamv3.GetOr(result, "location", "")
        count := streamv3.GetOr(result, "employee_count", int64(0))
        fmt.Printf("%s - %s: %d employees\n", dept, location, count)
    }
}
```

### 2. Time Series Analysis

**Request:**
```
"Analyze website traffic data by day, calculate 7-day moving average, identify days with traffic 20% above average"
```

### 3. Real-Time Monitoring

**Request:**
```
"Monitor API response times in 1-minute windows, calculate average response time, alert if average exceeds 500ms"
```

### 4. Complex Joins

**Request:**
```
"Join product catalog with sales data and inventory, find products that are selling well but have low stock levels"
```

## Verifying Generated Code

### Quick Verification Checklist

When you receive generated code, check these items:

#### ‚úÖ **Structure Check**
- [ ] Has `package main` and `func main()`
- [ ] Includes all necessary imports
- [ ] Handles errors from file operations
- [ ] Uses descriptive variable names

#### ‚úÖ **StreamV3 API Check**
- [ ] Uses current function names (`Select`, `Where`, `Limit`)
- [ ] Uses `streamv3.GetOr()` for record access
- [ ] Includes group names in `GroupByFields()` and `Aggregate()`
- [ ] Proper type parameters where needed

#### ‚úÖ **Logic Check**
- [ ] Processing steps are in logical order
- [ ] Each step is clearly understandable
- [ ] Variable names match their purpose
- [ ] Comments explain complex logic

#### ‚úÖ **Completeness Check**
- [ ] Addresses all parts of your request
- [ ] Includes output/display logic
- [ ] Has proper error handling
- [ ] Code looks complete and runnable

### Common Issues to Watch For

#### ‚ùå **API Mistakes**
```go
// Wrong - old API
result := streamv3.Map(fn)(data)      // Should be Select
result := streamv3.Filter(fn)(data)   // Should be Where
result := streamv3.Take(10)(data)     // Should be Limit
```

#### ‚ùå **Unsafe Record Access**
```go
// Wrong - direct map access could panic
name := record["name"].(string)

// Correct - use GetOr for safe access
name := streamv3.GetOr(record, "name", "")
```

#### ‚ùå **Unsafe Record Access**
```go
// Wrong - could panic
name := record["name"].(string)

// Correct
name := streamv3.GetOr(record, "name", "")
```

## Iterating and Refining

### When the First Result Isn't Perfect

#### Strategy 1: Ask for Clarification
```
"The code looks good, but can you add comments explaining the aggregation step?"
```

#### Strategy 2: Request Modifications
```
"Can you modify this to also calculate the standard deviation of sales amounts?"
```

#### Strategy 3: Ask for Simplification
```
"This code is a bit complex. Can you break it into simpler steps with more descriptive variable names?"
```

#### Strategy 4: Request Different Approach
```
"Instead of grouping by region first, can you filter for high-value sales first, then group?"
```

### Example Iteration Session

**Initial Request:**
```
"Analyze sales data to find top-performing products"
```

**LLM Response:** *[generates basic code]*

**Your Follow-up:**
```
"Good start! Can you modify this to:
1. Only include sales from the last 30 days
2. Calculate both revenue and unit sales
3. Show the top 10 products by revenue
4. Create a bar chart of the results"
```

**LLM Response:** *[generates enhanced code with all requirements]*

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Multi-Step Requests

Break complex analyses into phases:

```
"First, help me understand this data structure. Then I'll ask you to build the analysis pipeline."

Phase 1: "Read my sales.csv and show me what fields are available and some sample records"
Phase 2: "Now create analysis to find seasonal sales patterns by product category"
Phase 3: "Add visualization and export the results to Excel format"
```

### 2. Template Creation

Ask the LLM to create reusable templates:

```
"Create a template function that can analyze any CSV file to find top N records by any numeric field, with flexible grouping"
```

### 3. Domain-Specific Language

Teach the LLM your domain terminology:

```
"In our retail business:
- 'SKU' means product identifier
- 'COGS' means cost of goods sold
- 'LTV' means customer lifetime value

Now analyze our product performance using these terms."
```

### 4. Error Handling Strategies

Request robust error handling:

```
"Generate the sales analysis code, but make it robust - handle missing files, empty data, and invalid field values gracefully"
```

### 5. Performance Optimization

Ask for performance considerations:

```
"The previous code works but might be slow with large files. Can you optimize it for processing 1M+ records efficiently?"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Problems and Solutions

#### Problem: Code Uses Wrong Function Names
**Symptoms:** `Map()`, `Filter()`, `Take()` instead of `Select()`, `Where()`, `Limit()`

**Solution:**
```
"Please update this code to use the current StreamV3 API: Select instead of Map, Where instead of Filter, Limit instead of Take"
```

#### Problem: Complex, Hard-to-Read Code
**Symptoms:** Deeply nested function calls, unclear variable names

**Solution:**
```
"Can you rewrite this with simpler, step-by-step processing? Use descriptive variable names and break complex operations into separate steps."
```

#### Problem: Missing Error Handling
**Symptoms:** File operations without error checks

**Solution:**
```
"Please add proper error handling for all file operations and CSV reading"
```

#### Problem: Incorrect Aggregation Syntax
**Symptoms:** Missing group names in `Aggregate()` calls

**Solution:**
```
"The Aggregate function needs a group name as the first parameter. Please fix the aggregation calls."
```

#### Problem: Type Issues
**Symptoms:** Compiler errors about types

**Solution:**
```
"There seem to be some type issues. Can you add explicit type parameters where needed, like CountWindow[streamv3.Record](10)?"
```

### When Your LLM Gets Confused

#### Reset and Restart
If the LLM starts generating incorrect code consistently:

1. Start a new conversation
2. Reapply the prompt template
3. Rephrase your request more clearly
4. Provide a simple example first

#### Provide Examples
Show the LLM what good code looks like:

**Example request:**

> "Here's an example of the coding style I want:
>
> ```go
> // Read and filter data
> salesData := streamv3.ReadCSV("sales.csv")
>
> highValueSales := streamv3.Where(func(r streamv3.Record) bool {
>     amount := streamv3.GetOr(r, "amount", 0.0)
>     return amount > 1000
> })(salesData)
> ```
>
> Now create similar code for analyzing customer data."

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Simple, Build Complexity

```
‚úÖ Good Progression:
1. "Read sales.csv and show first 10 records"
2. "Filter for sales > $100"
3. "Group by region and calculate totals"
4. "Create chart of results"

‚ùå Avoid:
"Build a comprehensive sales analytics dashboard with real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and machine learning"
```

### 2. Be Specific About Data

```
‚úÖ Good:
"The CSV has columns: customer_id, order_date, product_name, quantity, unit_price, total_amount"

‚ùå Vague:
"Analyze the sales data"
```

### 3. Request Human-Readable Code

```
‚úÖ Always ask for:
"Make the code easy to read and verify, with descriptive variable names and clear steps"

‚ùå Don't accept:
Complex nested function calls that are hard to understand
```

### 4. Verify Each Step

```
‚úÖ Good practice:
"Before adding the chart, let me verify the data processing logic first"

‚ùå Risky:
Accepting large, complex code without reviewing each component
```

### 5. Build a Library of Patterns

Save successful request patterns:

```
üìÅ Your Pattern Library:
- "Read [file], filter for [condition], group by [field], calculate [metric]"
- "Process [data] in [time] windows, detect [pattern], alert when [condition]"
- "Join [dataset1] with [dataset2], find [insight], create [visualization]"
```

### 6. Test with Small Data First

```
‚úÖ Smart approach:
"Generate code to test with a small sample file first, then we'll apply it to the full dataset"

‚ùå Risky:
Running generated code on large production datasets without testing
```
